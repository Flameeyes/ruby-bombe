    # Base class for bombe's backends
    #
    # This is the fundament of the whole bombe backend system, all the
    # bombe backends derive from this class. This class defines the
    # interface of all the backends and takes care of throwing
    # NotImplementedError exceptions when a method is missing.
    #
    # Note: the primitive methods are all handled by this class, the
    # specific backends need to add a postfix underscore to their
    # implementations, and they need to make it private.
    class Base

      # Seek in the backend. This function will take care, among other
      # things, to check if the seek is valid, or if it would try to
      # get to a negative position, and if the whence is valid.
      def seek(amount, whence = ::IO::SEEK_SET)
        # if the backend does not implement seeking, throw an
        # exception

      # (file descriptors, memory maps, temporary files, ...).
      #
      # Since all the backends should be closed after use is
      # terminated, this function cannot raise exceptions for missing
      # implementations; on the other hand, backends might not require
      # any task after use, so allow the internal close_ method to be
      # missing.
      #
      # Also, some backends allow recursive destruction for the
      # arguments they are passed; for instance a Gzip backend
      # instance might wish to recursively close the GzipReader
      # instance it was given at opening, so add an optional recursive
      # parameter that allows for requesting recursive closing.
      #
      # Some backends might allow users to pass parameters from which
      # to build their internal data access, in which case they'd also
      # have to close it even if the user doesn't ask them to, so
      # allow a @force_recursive_close variable to be set to true, to
      # force closing.
