      # missing.

      # arguments they are passed; for instance a Gzip backend

      # instance it was given at opening, so add an optional recursive
      # parameter that allows for requesting recursive closing.
      #
      # To simplify the logic, instead of creating a close_ internal
      # method for all the subclasses, this method will invoke the
      # method in two arrays: @teardown_always and
      # @teardown_recursive.  The subclasses can add during initialize
      # the Method objects for their teardown actions to those.
