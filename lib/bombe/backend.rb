    # Base class for bombe's backends

    # This is the fundament of the whole bombe backend system, all the
    # bombe backends derive from this class. This class defines the
    # interface of all the backends and takes care of throwing
    # NotImplementedError exceptions when a method is missing.
    #
    # Note: the primitive methods are all handled by this class, the
    # specific backends need to add a postfix underscore to their
    # implementations, and they need to make it private.
