    # Base class for bombe's backends

    # This is the fundament of the whole bombe backend system, all the
    # bombe backends derive from this class. This class defines the
    # interface of all the backends and takes care of throwing
    # NotImplementedError exceptions when a method is missing.
    #
    # Note: the primitive methods are all handled by this class, the
    # specific backends need to add a postfix underscore to their
    # implementations, and they need to make it private.

      # Since all the backends should be closed after use is
      # terminated, this function cannot raise exceptions for missing
      # implementations; on the other hand, backends might not require
      # any task after use, so allow the internal close_ method to be
      # missing.
      #
      # Also, some backends allow recursive destruction for the
      # arguments they are passed; for instance a Gzip backend
      # instance might wish to recursively close the GzipReader
      # instance it was given at opening, so add an optional recursive
      # parameter that allows for requesting recursive closing.
      #
      # To simplify the logic, instead of creating a close_ internal
      # method for all the subclasses, this method will invoke the
      # method in two arrays: @teardown_always and
      # @teardown_recursive.  The subclasses can add during initialize
      # the Method objects for their teardown actions to those.

      # parameter, it might be a good idea to call it.
