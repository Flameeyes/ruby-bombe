  # Socket backend
  #
  # This class is a specialised IO backend that allows for reading
  # data out of a Socket instance. The Socket case is a special case
  # since it does not allow seeking in any way.
  class Socket < IO
    # Create a Socket backend instance
    #
    # This should allow a Socket instance to be passed as parameter.
    # TODO: it should allow for an Hash to be passed with :host, :port
    # and :protocol parameters to open a new Socket instance.

      # Since Socket, TCPSocket and UDPSocket are implemented in a
      # binary extension, they are not parent and child here, so they
      # have to be listed separately; nonetheless, they are all IO
      # instances, which is good for us. To add support for Unix or
      # other sockets, add them to the array here.
