require 'bombe/backend'

# Set of functions to emulate a cursor in a bombe backend.
#
# Bombe's interface allow sequential access with seek and tell
# functions to have some sort of random data access. Some backends,
# though, lack any support for sequential access, as they are designed
# for random data access, like arrays and strings.
#
# When you include this module, special seek and tell functions are
# added, that allow for emulation of seek and tell functions.
