module Bombe::Backend
  # String backend
  #
  # This class implements a memory-hungry backend that simply access a
  # string. String-based (but also Array-based) acces allows for
  # reading files directly from memory, like files uncompressed
  # entirely into memory.
  #
  # Note that creating a backend instance of this backend through an
  # Array (rather than a String) requires a long time especially for
  # big arrays since all the elements are tested to ensure that it is
  # indeed an array of bytes, rather than an array of mixed integers
  # or anything like that.
  class String < Base
    include CursorEmulation

    # Exception thrown when the array is not a byte array (for
    # instance if it is a mixed type array or if it contains integers
    # > 255 or < 0.
    class InvalidArray < Exception
      def message
        "The given array is not an array of bytes."
