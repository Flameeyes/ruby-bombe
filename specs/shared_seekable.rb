# Shared examples for seekable backends and instances.
#
# This code is split out of specs_template.rb since it's complex
# enough to stay on its own.

# Description for seekable backends classes.
#
# This shared example contain the tests to execute on the backends
# that support seeking (like File-backed backends).

#

# instances of seekable backends.
