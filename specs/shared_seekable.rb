# Shared examples for seekable backends and instances.
#
# This code is split out of specs_template.rb since it's complex
# enough to stay on its own.

# Description for non-seekable backends instances
#
# Make sure seekable backends respond to the seek and tell
# methods. Although all the backends technically have those methods
# (they are defined in Backend::Base), they are also hidden when their
# internal counterpart is missing. Make sure that they are hidden
# here.

# Description for seekable backends instances

# instances of seekable backends.

# size, so we can seek around up to that.
